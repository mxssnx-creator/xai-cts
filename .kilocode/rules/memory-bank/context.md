# Active Context: CTS v3 Website

## Current State

**Project Status**: ✅ Original CTS website restored and loading

The workspace now contains the restored CTS v3 application from the upstream `v0/cts5` branch. The original route structure, dashboard UI, API surface, and support modules are back in place and the application responds successfully in development.

## Recently Completed

- [x] Fixed workflow-logger.ts: storage/retrieval mismatch (was using client.set vs client.zrevrange - fixed to use lpush/lrange consistently)

- [x] Reconciled cross-system workflow contracts in system verifier, engine auto-start status checks, API handler response typing, and dashboard connection state normalization
- [x] Fixed strict typing breakpoints in settings/indications UI, active connection manager/cards, script harnesses, chat display time arithmetic, and duplicate stats object keys
- [x] Fixed sidemenu styling issues by adding missing CSS variables (`--sidebar-*`) to `globals.css`

- [x] Normalized boolean parsing for connection flags (`"0"/"1"/"true"`) in state and settings managers to prevent false-positive enabled states
- [x] Stabilized dashboard toggle workflow to preserve insertion state (`is_inserted`/`is_dashboard_inserted`) while only toggling processing enablement
- [x] Updated connections API migration behavior to stop auto-resetting non-auto exchanges on every GET request
- [x] Hardened Redis migration auto-fix to deterministically ensure 4 base connections exist in the `connections` set and inject real env credentials when available
- [x] Synced sidebar content back to upstream `v0/cts5` structure for title/auth/footer behavior consistency
- [x] Upgraded engine startup + quickstart workflow: global start now triggers coordinator workers (`startAll` + `refreshEngines`), quickstart now enables dashboard state and 4-base readiness checks
- [x] Fixed progression visibility gaps: progression counters now persist every cycle (not every 10 cycles), progression logs API now falls back to structured logs when normal logs are empty
- [x] Rebuilt detailed logs aggregation to combine all active/base connection logs and metrics (instead of single focus-only view)
- [x] Improved functional overview metrics by reading `trade_engine_state` from settings namespace and falling back to progression-state counters
- [x] Removed remaining dashboard UI placeholder defaults (system load/database size now initialize at 0 until real metrics load)
- [x] Bound detailed logging dialog to selected exchange/connection context and added API filtering (`connectionId` / `exchange`) so UI always reflects real selected scope
- [x] Improved progression logs endpoint to merge/fallback structured engine logs and engine-state counters when primary progression logs are sparse
- [x] Removed Binance/OKX from Dashboard Active (Main) base exchange set; active panel now uses only bybit, bingx, pionex, orangex
- [x] Enforced defaults: base connections are enabled in Settings by default, while Dashboard main enable state remains OFF by default
- [x] Updated engine eligibility filters to follow dashboard enable state (not settings-default enabled), preventing unintended auto-processing
- [x] Hardened migration startup path so base-connection credential injection runs even when migrations are already marked as run in-process
- [x] Fixed startup auto-reenable regression by removing pre-startup logic that force-enabled dashboard toggles for bybit/bingx
- [x] Updated migration defaults and system credential-injection helpers to preserve `is_enabled_dashboard` state instead of setting it ON implicitly
- [x] Aligned auto-start engine eligibility to require BOTH `is_active_inserted` and `is_enabled_dashboard`, preventing processing when Main toggle is OFF
- [x] Renamed UI terminology: Settings now consistently uses "Base Connections" and Dashboard uses "Main Connections (Active Connections)"
- [x] Hardened migration execution to prevent concurrent duplicate runs via in-flight promise lock and fixed migration 012 schema-version write bug (`_schema_version=12`)
- [x] Fixed process migration guard persistence by syncing `setMigrationsRun()`/`haveMigrationsRun()` with `globalThis.__migrations_run`
- [x] Added duplicate-loop protection for periodic connection testing so repeated startup/health calls do not spawn multiple intervals
- [x] Optimized Redis-heavy workflow reads: parallelized connection/trade/position fetches and added short TTL + in-flight dedupe cache for dashboard workflow snapshots
- [x] Improved logistics queue payload to avoid hardcoded symbol placeholders; now derives focus symbol from real progression log details when available
- [x] Cleaned migration set-initialization logic to stop inserting empty-string placeholder members into Redis sets
- [x] Marked long-running background timers (`redis` TTL cleanup, progression-log flush, periodic connection testing) as non-blocking via `unref()` to prevent script/test hang loops
- [x] Production-readiness lint pipeline restored: replaced `eslint-config-next` patch-dependent setup with stable flat ESLint config using `@typescript-eslint` + `@next/eslint-plugin-next`
- [x] Fixed unsafe interface/class name collision in workflow event handler (`WorkflowEventSubscriber` split) to satisfy strict lint safety rules
- [x] Hardened QA scripts for current environment defaults: API/system E2E scripts now respect `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`/`APP_URL` and use valid market-data assertions
- [x] Verified full quality gate (`bun lint`, `bun typecheck`, `bun run build`) now passes after stabilization changes
- [x] Fixed BingX credential persistence path: removed legacy duplicate base/default-disabled seed behavior and enforced canonical base IDs (`bingx-x01` etc.) with credential injection from env
- [x] Added env credential resolver (`lib/env-credentials.ts`) with alias + quote/whitespace normalization so provided BingX secrets are reliably loaded
- [x] Updated startup/system credential injection endpoints and migration hooks to use normalized env reads, preventing blank BingX creation when alternate env naming is used
- [x] Reworked startup/base seeding to canonical IDs only (`bybit-x03`, `bingx-x01`, `pionex-x01`, `orangex-x01`) and removed legacy IDs (`*-base`, `*-default-disabled`) that caused duplicate/blank BingX entries
- [x] Added defensive credential-preservation in connection PUT/PATCH routes so empty form payloads no longer wipe stored API keys/secrets
- [x] Normalized available-connections filtering to canonical base IDs and fixed credential checks to require both key+secret lengths
- [x] Added dotenv fallback parsing in env credential resolver (`.env.local`/`.env`) to load provided credentials even when process env is not preloaded
- [x] Switched canonical base-connection provisioning to predefined in-code credentials (no env-var dependency) across migrations, default seeding, init-status auto-injection, and system credential/fix endpoints
- [x] Completed connection-system conformity hardening pass: normalized boolean input/flag handling across toggle APIs, removed SQL/Redis split in critical connection mutation routes, fixed batch-test limiter window semantics, ensured credential injection also maintains `connections` set membership, and corrected coordinator credential/state gating + health refresh behavior
- [x] Repaired dashboard monitoring/info/state stability: normalized Smart Overview and Monitoring payload handling, fixed symbols stats contract mismatch (`openPositions` vs `livePositions`), added DB size estimation in monitoring API, and improved Symbols Overview responsive layout for mobile/tablet density
- [x] Verified all quality gates pass: `bun typecheck`, `bun lint`, and `bun run build` all complete successfully

## Current Structure

| File/Directory | Purpose | Status |
|----------------|---------|--------|
| `app/` | Main Next.js app routes and pages | ✅ Restored |
| `app/api/` | CTS API endpoints | ✅ Restored |
| `components/` | Dashboard and UI components | ✅ Restored |
| `lib/` | Trading, exchange, settings, and system logic | ✅ Restored |

## Current Focus

Current focus is runtime correctness and operational workflow completeness for the recovered CTS application, with remaining effort centered on lint-toolchain compatibility and incremental UX hardening.

## Known Issues

- Sandbox preview routing still needs to target the real app process instead of the placeholder service on port `3000`
- `bun run lint` currently fails at tool bootstrap (`@rushstack/eslint-patch` with ESLint 9) before rule evaluation; this is a lint-toolchain compatibility issue, not a TypeScript/runtime blocker
- Preview routing to the sandbox website panel is still external to the repo even though `/tracking` and `/logistics` now build and run correctly
- A stale `.next` directory can still cause misleading module-resolution build failures; clearing `.next` remains the correct workaround before rebuilds
